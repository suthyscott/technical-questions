1. **What is a closure in JavaScript, and why is it useful in practice? Provide an example of a closure and explain how it works.**
*Answer:* A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function's scope, and the global scope. It "closes over" the variables in its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are useful for maintaining private variables, creating factory functions, and handling asynchronous operations with callbacks.


2. **Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript. How does it affect the interpretation of variables and functions in code execution?**
*Answer:* Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means you can use a variable or function before it's declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.


3. **What is the Event Loop in JavaScript, and how does it relate to asynchronous programming? Describe the key components and their roles in managing the execution stack.**
*Answer:* The Event Loop is a critical part of JavaScript's concurrency model. It manages the execution stack, handling asynchronous operations using a message queue. It consists of the Call Stack (for function calls), Web APIs (for asynchronous tasks), the Callback Queue (for resolved promises and events), and the Event Loop itself. The Event Loop continuously checks the queue for messages and moves them to the call stack when it's empty.


4. **Explain the differences between "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript. How and when would you encounter each of these values in code?**
*Answer:* "null" is an intentional absence of any value and is often used to represent the absence of an object. "undefined" is a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It can also be the default return value of a function. You would encounter "null" when you explicitly set a variable to it or when an API or function returns "null." You would encounter "undefined" when you access a variable that hasn't been assigned a value, or when a function doesn't explicitly return a value.


5. **What is the purpose of the "this" keyword in JavaScript, and how does its value change in different contexts (e.g., function, object method, constructor)?**
*Answer:* The "this" keyword refers to the current execution context and its value can change based on how a function is called. In a global function, "this" refers to the global object (e.g., "window" in browsers). In an object method, "this" refers to the object that the method is called on. In a constructor, "this" refers to the newly created instance.


6. **Explain the concept of callbacks in JavaScript. How are they used to handle asynchronous operations, and what are the potential issues associated with the "callback hell" (callback pyramid)?**
*Answer*: Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed at a later time, often used to handle asynchronous operations. Callback hell, or the "pyramid of doom," is a situation where multiple nested callbacks make the code hard to read and maintain. It can lead to issues like callback hell and make code harder to understand and maintain.


7. **Describe the differences between "==" and "===" in JavaScript for comparing values. What is type coercion, and how does it affect the results of comparisons using these operators?**
*Answer:* "==" is the loose equality operator that compares values, attempting to perform type coercion if necessary. "===" is the strict equality operator that compares values without type coercion. Type coercion is the automatic conversion of data types during a comparison. For example, "2" == 2 would return true because JavaScript coerces the string to a number, while "2" === 2 would return false because it doesn't perform type coercion.


8. **What are JavaScript Promises, and how do they simplify working with asynchronous operations? Provide examples of creating and using Promises.**
*Answer:* JavaScript Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured and readable manner. They represent a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future. Promises have two states: pending, and resolved or rejected. You can create a Promise to perform an asynchronous task and use the then method to handle the result or catch to handle errors.


9. **How does the "let," "const," and "var" keywords differ in JavaScript when declaring variables? When and why would you use one over the others?**
*Answer:* The "let" and "const" keywords were introduced in ES6 and have block scope, while "var" has function scope. "let" allows variable reassignment, while "const" enforces immutability for variable values. Use "let" for variables that may change, "const" for constants, and "var" should be avoided in favor of "let" and "const."


10. **What are arrow functions in JavaScript, and how do they differ from regular function expressions? When would you choose to use arrow functions, and what are their limitations?**
*Answer:* Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax and inherit the "this" value from their surrounding code(where they're created, not where they're called). They are suitable for short, simple functions, but they cannot be used as constructors, have no "arguments" object, and may not work well in certain cases that require a specific "this" context.
