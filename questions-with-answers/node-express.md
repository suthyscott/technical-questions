**1. Q: What is Node.js, and how does it relate to web development?**
   A: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's commonly used in web development to build server-side applications and APIs.

**2. Q: Explain the role of Express.js in web development.**
   A: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies building web applications and APIs. It provides tools and features to handle routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.

**3. Q: What is middleware in Express.js, and why is it important?**
   A: Middleware in Express.js are functions that process HTTP requests. They are essential for tasks like authentication, logging, and request parsing. Middleware can be used to modify the request or response objects before reaching the route handler.

**4. Q: How do you set up a basic HTTP server using Node.js and Express.js?**
   A: To create a basic server, you can use Express like this:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;
   
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });
   
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

**5. Q: What is routing (or what are endpoints) in Express.js, and how do you define routes/endpoints?**
   A: Routing in Express.js refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint. You can define routes using HTTP methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, and `app.use()`.

**6. Q: How can you handle form data and query parameters in an Express.js application?**
   A: You can use the `body-parser` middleware to handle form data, and you can access query parameters using `req.query` in your route handlers.

**7. Q: What are route parameters in Express.js, and how do you use them?**
   A: Route parameters are placeholders in route paths that capture values from the URL. For example, `app.get('/users/:id')` can capture the user's ID from the URL, which you can access using `req.params.id`.

**8. Q: What is a session and how can you set one up in your Express application?**
   A: A session is a mechanism in web development for persistently storing and managing user-specific data across multiple HTTP requests, often used for tasks like maintaining login status and user preferences. In an Express.js application, you can set up a session using the `express-session` middleware. First, you install the middleware with `npm install express-session`, and then you configure it, specifying options like a secret key for session data encryption, whether to resave unchanged sessions, and whether to save uninitialized sessions. Once configured, you can store and retrieve data on the `req.session` object within your routes to manage user-specific information, but for secure and scalable usage in production, it's essential to employ session stores such as Redis or a database to store session data. Proper session management and security practices, including setting session expiration times and protecting the session ID, are critical for safeguarding user data and privacy.


**9. Q: Explain the concept of middleware chaining in Express.js.**
   A: Middleware chaining in Express allows you to apply multiple middleware functions to a single route. The order in which you define middleware matters, as they execute in the order they are defined.

**10. Q: How do you set up and configure Express.js to serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images?**
    A: You can use the `express.static` middleware to serve static files. For example:
    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static('public'));
    ```
    This code would serve files from a "public" directory in your project.
    You can also setup standard endpoints and use `res.sendFile` or `res.send` to send back html files or plain html.
