1. **What is Git, and why is it essential for web development?**
   - Answer: Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. It's crucial for collaboration, tracking versions, and managing code repositories efficiently.

2. **What is a "repository" in Git and GitHub?**
   - Answer: A repository, often called "repo," is a location where Git stores all the files, commit history, and metadata for a project. GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories remotely.

3. **Explain the difference between Git and GitHub.**
   - Answer: Git is the version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting and collaboration features for Git repositories. You use Git locally, and GitHub is for remote collaboration and storage.

4. **What is a "commit" in Git, and why is it important?**
   - Answer: A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the code. It's crucial for tracking changes, documenting work, and maintaining a history of a project's development.

5. **What is a "pull request" in GitHub?**
   - Answer: A pull request is a feature in GitHub that allows developers to propose changes to a repository. Other team members can review, discuss, and approve these changes before merging them into the main codebase.

6. **How do you create a new branch in Git, and why would you need one?**
   - Answer: You can create a new branch in Git using the `git branch` or `git checkout -b` command. Branches are useful for isolating and working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main code until they're ready.

7. **What is the purpose of the ".gitignore" file?**
   - Answer: The ".gitignore" file specifies which files and directories should be excluded from version control. It's essential to prevent sensitive or unnecessary files from being added to the repository.

8. **Explain the difference between "git pull" and "git fetch" commands.**
   - Answer: "git pull" fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch, while "git fetch" only fetches the changes, allowing you to review and merge them manually.

9. **What is the Git workflow for collaborating with a team?**
   - Answer: A common Git workflow includes creating branches for specific tasks, making commits, and pushing changes to a shared repository. Team members review changes through pull requests and merge them into the main branch when ready.

10. **How can you revert to a previous commit in Git?**
    - Answer: You can revert to a previous commit using the "git reset" or "git checkout" commands. "git reset" is used for undoing changes and moving the branch pointer, while "git checkout" allows you to temporarily switch to a specific commit.
