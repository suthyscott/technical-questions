1. **Question:** What does CSS stand for, and what is its primary purpose in web development?
   **Answer:** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Its primary purpose is to control the visual presentation and layout of web pages, allowing developers to style HTML elements.

2. **Question:** What is the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS styles?
   **Answer:** Inline CSS is applied directly within the HTML element using the `style` attribute, internal CSS is placed within a `<style>` tag in the HTML document, and external CSS is stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML using `<link>` tags.

3. **Question:** How do you select an HTML element with a specific ID in CSS, and what's the syntax for it?
   **Answer:** To select an element with a specific ID in CSS, you use the `#` symbol followed by the ID name. For example, to select an element with the ID "myElement," you would write `#myElement { /* CSS rules here */ }`.

4. **Question:** Explain the concept of the CSS box model.
   **Answer:** The CSS box model describes how elements are rendered in a rectangular box, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin. It affects an element's size and spacing.

5. **Question:** How can you center an element horizontally and vertically in CSS?
   **Answer:** To center an element vertically or horizontally, you typically use the `flexbox` or `grid` layout techniques. To center an element horizontally, you can also set its left and right margins to "auto."

6. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `z-index` property in CSS?

7. **Question:** How can you create a responsive web design using CSS?
   **Answer:** A responsive design can be achieved by using media queries to adapt the layout and styles based on the user's device or screen size. Media queries allow you to define different CSS rules for various screen widths.

8. **Question:** What is the difference between `margin` and `padding` in CSS?
   **Answer:** `Margin` is the space outside an element, affecting the space between elements, while `padding` is the space inside an element, affecting the space between an element's content and its border.

9. **Question:** Explain the purpose of pseudo-classes in CSS and provide an example.
   **Answer:** Pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element. For example, `:hover` is a pseudo-class that allows you to define styles when the mouse pointer hovers over an element.

10. **Question:** What is the importance of the "Cascading" in CSS, and how does it work?
    **Answer:** The "Cascading" part of CSS means that multiple style rules can apply to the same element, and they cascade down in a specific order of importance. The order of importance is inline styles (highest priority), internal styles, external styles, and browser default styles (lowest priority). When there are conflicting rules, specificity and source order are used to determine which rule is applied.
