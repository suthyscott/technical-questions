# The Hot Seat

The purpose of this activity is to help students prepare for technical questions in interviews. The topics are taken from the most common and important technologies taught at Devmountain. The exercise is meant to help students identify which topics they need to research more, as well as provide a guide for what to study when preparing for interviews.

## How to play

Each project group is a team. The members of the teams will take turns on the spot, one at a time from each team in an alternating pattern. 

Each person on the spot chooses a random number from a category (the numbers generally do not represent levels of difficulty) and has a chance to answer the question. If they can't answer or don't fully answer, the opposite team gets a chance to answer, and if they do not successfully answer the person's own team has another shot, minus one point. 

Points are awarded as follows: 
0 for a completely incorrect answer or unable to answer
1 somewhat relevant answer
3 mostly correct answer
5 fully correct answer

Play until all questions have been answered or your time runs out.
