# Welcome to Scott's technical-questions repo


Each project group is a team. The members of the teams will take turns on the spot, one at a time from each team in an alternating pattern. 

Each person on the spot chooses a random number from a category (the numbers generally do not represent levels of difficulty) and has a chance to answer the question. If they can't answer or don't fully answer, the opposite team gets a chance to answer, and if they do not successfully answer the person's own team has another shot, minus one point. 

Points are awarded as follows: 
0 for a completely incorrect answer or unable to answer
1 somewhat relevant answer
3 mostly correct answer
5 fully correct answer

Play until all questions have been answered or your time runs out.
